As a mentor it will be my responsibility to make sure that students graduate from the bootcamp. This means that I am responsible for students completing any given tasks/assignments, answering any questions that students may have without giving them the answer directly, but just guiding into the correct direction. Another one of my key responsibilities will be to make sure that students don’t drop out, and to  keep a close eye on those who will potentially drop out. This means that I will have to watch out for change in behavioural patterns, such as assignment submission dates and amount of courses taken/completed per week/month.

Seeing that the mentors and students don’t usually meet, I would suggest that, if I do see drop out factors, I meet with the student for coffee to talk about why they are slacking in their course work and try to find the root of the problem as well as a potential solution. 

Once the solution has been found I will encourage the student to continue to learn coding, explain to them the great opportunities that awaits them in the field and how much it can change their lives. I will also do follow-ups on the student to ensure that everything is going well.
