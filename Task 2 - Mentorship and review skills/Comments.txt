Hi There,

I currently a moveable character on a webpage but I want prevent it from going out of the screen's bounds.
Please could you give me an idea and some basic code on how to approach this problem?

Thanks!

==================

Hello there!

Before I try and answer your question, let's take a look at your code quality.
-HTML - Poor. No indentation, try to put your comments above whatever it is that you are commenting about.
-CSS - Poor. Indentation does not line up, styles for body goes before styles for img.
-JS - Good. Good use of comments, spacing and indentation is also good. Error-free code, well done!

Now to get back to your question, I have seen your code and think I know what the problem might be, try adding an event listener for both the x- and y-axis in your code.

I hope I have helped you move a step in the right direction.
